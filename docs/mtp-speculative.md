# MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) Speculative Decoding

## Overview

MTP is a speculative decoding technique where a small **drafter model** predicts
several candidate tokens, and the large **verifier model** validates them in one
batched forward pass. If the drafter's predictions match, multiple tokens are
accepted per step — up to 3× speedup.

This document covers the custom-drafter/MTP track. The separate stock-weight
speculative scaffold inspired by Orthrus lives in [orthrus.md](orthrus.md): it
uses normal model weights, pluggable cheap proposers, structured stats, and the
`cmd/specbench` CSV harness, but currently verifies with `backend=replay` until
a KV-reusing verifier block is implemented.

## Architecture

### Drafter models

Local E2B BF16 asset: `models/gemma4-e2b-mtp-drafter`.

Local 31B MLX 4-bit assistant asset: `models/gemma4-31b-it-mtp-assistant-4bit`.

- Top-level `model_type: gemma4_assistant`, `architectures: [Gemma4AssistantForCausalLM]`
- Nested text config is `model_type: gemma4_text`
- `hidden_size: 256` (vs 1536 in main model)
- `num_hidden_layers: 4` (vs 35 in main model)
- `intermediate_size: 2048`
- `num_attention_heads: 4`, `num_key_value_heads: 1`
- layer types: 3 sliding layers (`head_dim=256`) + 1 full layer (`global_head_dim=512`)
- `num_kv_shared_layers: 4`; all drafter layers consume external/shared KV rather than owning K/V projections
- Disk: 151 MB BF16 safetensors + 31 MB tokenizer
- VRAM estimate: ~50 MB plus runtime buffers

### Special tensors in local E2B safetensors
- `pre_projection.weight`: `[256, 3072]` — maps `embedding(prev_token)[1536] || activation[1536]` into drafter hidden size 256.
- `post_projection.weight`: `[1536, 256]` — maps drafter hidden/projected state back to the main hidden size for the next drafter step and verifier handoff.
- `masked_embedding.centroids.weight`: `[2048, 256]` — centroid embedding table.
- `masked_embedding.token_ordering`: `[262144]` — vocab → centroid ordering/index data.
- `model.embed_tokens.weight`: `[262144, 256]` — drafter-token embedding table.
- Per-layer tensors include only `q_proj`, `q_norm`, `o_proj`, MLP weights, norms, and `layer_scalar`.
- **No `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `k_norm`, or `v_norm` tensors exist in the drafter**; those must come from shared/base-model KV state.

Current implementation status (after the backend/model reorganization; Qwen-specific code now lives in `model/qwen`, Gemma4 diagnostics in `model/gemma4`, and generation extraction remains future work):
- `LoadGemma4MTPDrafter` loads the local assistant assets into a dedicated q-only drafter structure, including exact-shape/config validation for `pre_projection`, `post_projection`, optional masked embedding tensors, and all four q-only layers.
- The 31B assistant path keeps large MLX 4-bit matrices packed (`EmbedTokensMLX`, projection weights, attention weights, and MLP weights) and dispatches q-only drafter GEMVs through `backends/mlx` on-the-fly compute instead of expanding the assistant to F32. Token embedding lookup dequantizes only the requested row.
- Helper methods cover assistant token row copies, masked embedding ordering lookups, alias-safe `PreProjectInto`, and alias-safe `PostProjectInto`.
- Main-model helper primitives expose raw/scaled token embeddings, Gemma4 per-layer input preparation, a CPU decode finish helper that returns copied final activations, LM-head logits, and greedy argmax outside `Generate`; `Generate` now uses these shared helpers.
- `runtime/kv` staged KV helpers can checkpoint, restore, and keep only the accepted prefix plus verifier bonus token for both uncompressed and TurboQuant-backed KV caches.
- `AcceptMTPDraft`/`AcceptMTPDraftFromLogits` encode LiteRT-style accepted-prefix plus bonus-token semantics. `VerifiedCount` deliberately excludes the bonus token to match LiteRT-LM accounting, and `MTPAcceptance.Validate` rejects inconsistent manually assembled acceptance state before KV commit.
- `MTPVerifierPlan` prepares `[input_token]+drafted` token IDs and absolute verifier positions with model-aware token/vocab and overflow checks. `RunMTPVerifierForward` now provides an initial CPU verifier loop: it embeds each verifier token, runs configured real layers through `ForwardLayer`, validates float prompt/history KV and shared-KV source mappings, stages candidate float K/V updates, finishes decode via the shared CPU decode-finish helper, and returns per-position logits plus final activation. It explicitly rejects Gemma4 per-layer input/PLI until full verifier semantics are shared with `Generate`.
- `MTPVerifierResult` validates verifier logits/activation outputs, derives acceptance, and can commit the accepted KV prefix for float or TurboQuant-backed caches. `NewMTPVerifierResultForModel` additionally checks token IDs against vocab size, logits rows against vocab width, and final activation against hidden size for the real verifier path.
- `MTPAcceptance.KVKeepTokens` plus `CommitAccepted*KV` helpers apply accept/reject results directly to staged verifier KV caches; `runtime/kv` owns the generic staging state while `LayerKVDims` derives the correct per-layer widths for Gemma4 variable/shared KV layouts.
- Drafter layers mark `KVSourceLayer=-1` because their K/V source is external. `MTPDrafterExternalKV` is the explicit read-only main-model KV view for q-only drafter layers; validation checks source mapping, source sequence width, q-only projection dimensions, MLP dimensions, and all required norms.
- `RunMTPDrafterStepWithExternalKV` runs the projection shell plus the current CPU q-only layer path: Gemma-aware BF16/FP32 norms, q projection, q norm, Gemma-scaled external GQA attention, output projection, residual/post-attention handling, pre/post-FFN norms, MLP, layer scalar, final drafter norm, post-projection, main LM-head logits, and next-state construction. Zero-layer projection-only fixtures remain supported.
- `RunMTPDrafterSteps` runs a bounded internal multi-step drafter-only loop, carrying copied state between draft steps and returning drafted tokens, logits, activations, and final state. The real-asset contract test now loads the local Gemma4 main and MTP drafter assets when present, builds a minimal external-KV view, and proves one q-only drafter step reaches correctly shaped outputs.
- `cmd/gemma4mtpsmoke` and `cmd/llmgen -mtp-smoke` expose a runtime-facing smoke for the 31B path: load the main model on the on-the-fly 4-bit path, load the packed 4-bit assistant, build minimal external KV, run one q-only drafter step, and print timing/shape JSON. Latest local 31B minimal-KV smoke: main load `16.25s`, assistant load `0.26s`, drafter step `0.47s`, packed embedding/projection/layer weights all true.
- `BuildMTPPromptContext` and `llmgen -mtp-real-prompt` add the real prompt handoff: run the prompt through the Generate-equivalent Gemma4 per-layer-input path, capture final activation and float KV, map drafter layers onto compatible main-model KV source widths, and run the packed drafter against real verifier state. `GPUModel.BuildMTPPromptContext` does the same through the hybrid GPU/CPU path and copies GPU-resident KV back for MTP. Latest local 31B short-prompt real-KV smoke: CPU/on-the-fly `299.06s`, safer hybrid GPU `213.76s` with `-gpu-layers 17 -gpu-kv-max-seq 256`, aggressive hybrid GPU `200.32s` with `-gpu-layers 18 -gpu-kv-max-seq 64`.
- `MTPSpeculationStats` tracks LiteRT-style drafted/verified/bonus/output counters. `RunMTPSpeculativeStep` provides the compatibility one-token drafter→verifier→stats seam, while `RunMTPMultiDraftSpeculativeStep` drafts multiple tokens before one verifier pass. Both remain internal-only; the multi-draft path checkpoints float KV before verifier forward and restores staged KV on verifier or post-verifier stats errors.
- Remaining gap: convert the smoke seam into full generation: capture real verifier activation/KV from normal decode, extend the verifier path to full Gemma4 per-layer-input/batched semantics, prove q-only drafter numerical parity against real assistant assets, add adaptive draft-count policy, and wire accepted-KV commit into public speculative generation.

### Data flow

```
Main model decode step N:
  → hidden_state[1536]

Drafter loop (K iterations):
  hidden_draft = pre_projection(embedding(prev_token) || activation) [256]
  for layer in drafter_layers:
    hidden_draft = q-only layer(hidden_draft, KV=external main-model KV)
  hidden_main = post_projection(hidden_draft)                         [1536]
  logits = LM_head(hidden_main)                   [vocab]
  draft_token = argmax(logits)
  carry projected activation and drafted token into the next iteration
  → candidate_tokens[K]

Verifier (current internal CPU path):
  Run main model sequentially over [input_token] + K draft tokens with staged float KV
  Return G+1 logits rows plus final activation/projected state
  Accept matching prefix, emit verifier bonus token, discard rejected suffix

Verifier (target batched path):
  Share Gemma4 PLI/batched semantics with Generate/Prefill
  Run [input_token] + K draft tokens in one prefill-style verifier pass
  Commit only accepted-prefix + bonus KV after acceptance
```

### Performance gain
- Drafter: ~0.5ms per token (tiny model, 4 layers, dim=256)
- Verifier: ~5ms for K tokens batched (same as single-token decode)
- If 3/4 draft tokens accepted: 4 tokens for cost of ~7ms vs ~20ms sequential
- Net: ~2.8× throughput improvement

## Implementation plan

1. **Drafter loader** ✅ — parse `gemma4_assistant` top-level config, nested `text_config`, q-only attention blocks, `pre_projection`, `post_projection`, and masked embedding tensors.
2. **Main-model verifier helper primitives** ✅ — raw/scaled token embeddings, Gemma4 per-layer inputs, LM-head logits, and argmax are now reusable outside `Generate`.
3. **pre/post projection** ✅ — helper methods for `pre_projection(embedding(prev_token) || activation)` and `post_projection(hidden_draft)`.
4. **Accept/reject semantics** ✅ — `AcceptMTPDraft`/`AcceptMTPDraftFromLogits` keep the matching prefix and emit the verifier bonus token on mismatch/all-accepted completion.
5. **KV staging primitives** ✅ — checkpoint/restore/keep-prefix helpers support both uncompressed and TurboQuant-backed caches.
6. **KV cache sync primitive** ✅ — staged KV can keep `accepted_prefix_len + 1` verified positions and discard rejected candidate tails.
7. **Main-model verifier result contract** ✅ — `MTPVerifierTokens`/`MTPVerifierPlan`/`MTPVerifierResult` define `[input_token]+drafted`, verifier positions, logits rows, final activation, acceptance, and KV commit hooks; model-aware construction validates vocab/logit/activation dimensions.
8. **Verifier-forward contract** ✅ — `RunMTPVerifierForward` validates model/plan/KV-cache contract and rejects unsupported PLI/batched semantics explicitly.
9. **Initial CPU verifier path** ✅ — run a short sequential CPU forward over `[input_token] + drafted_tokens`, return per-position logits and final activation, and stage candidate float KV updates. The current implementation deliberately reuses `ForwardLayer` plus `finishCPUDecodeStep` rather than extracting a larger shared decode-step helper; a fuller helper should wait until Gemma4 PLI and batched verifier semantics are implemented so the shared boundary matches `Generate` completely.
10. **Drafter forward loop** ✅/internal — projection-only, synthetic q-only, and local real-asset contract paths now run with explicit external KV, Gemma-aware norms/attention scale, q-only attention, MLP, final norm, post-projection, and main LM-head logits. `RunMTPDrafterSteps` carries state across bounded multi-step drafts. Remaining work is numerical parity against real assistant outputs and adaptive policy.
11. **End-to-end speculative decode** ✅/internal — `RunMTPSpeculativeStep` integrates one drafter step, verifier forward, and stats without CLI exposure; `RunMTPMultiDraftSpeculativeStep` does the same for multiple drafted tokens in one verifier pass. Remaining work is KV commit policy inside generation, adaptive K, and production public wiring.
12. **31B packed smoke** ✅/experimental CLI — `cmd/gemma4mtpsmoke` and `llmgen -mtp-smoke` validate that the 31B main model and packed 4-bit assistant can execute one drafter step without dequantizing assistant matrices to F32.
13. **Real prompt activation/KV smoke** ✅/experimental CLI — `BuildMTPPromptContext` plus `llmgen -mtp-real-prompt` prove the main-model activation/KV handoff for Gemma4 31B, with CPU/on-the-fly prompt prefill still the dominant bottleneck.
14. **Adaptive K** — track acceptance rate by task/prompt class and adjust draft length.

Sources inspected:
- <https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM>

- `runtime/executor/llm_litert_compiled_model_executor.cc`

- HF model cards: `litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm`, `litert-community/gemma-4-E4B-it-litert-lm`

Key mechanics:
- MTP support is detected from the `.litertlm` bundle: presence of a TFLite model section with `model_type = "tf_lite_mtp_drafter"` marks the file as speculative-decoding-capable.
- The main model exposes a separate `verify` signature. LiteRT-LM infers the draft count from `verify.input_pos` shape: `num_draft_steps = len(input_pos) - 1`.
- The drafter model is compiled separately from the main prefill/decode model, with a `.mtp_drafter` compilation cache suffix.
- The first MTP call after prefill runs a normal single decode first, then passes that decode output's `activations` tensor into the drafter.
- Later MTP calls do not rerun a normal decode first; the drafter keeps enough internal state to restart from the last verifier activation.
- Drafter input `activations` is the concatenation of:
  - token embedding for the previous/generated token, looked up with `EmbeddingLookupManager.LookupDecode`, and
  - projected activations from either the previous drafter step or the verifier output.
  - LiteRT-LM comments describe this as `[B=1, T=1, D=3072]` for E2B/E4B-scale models: embedding `[1536]` + projected activation `[1536]`.
- Each drafter iteration runs the MTP drafter asynchronously, samples greedily from drafter `logits`, and carries forward `projected_activations` for the next drafter step.
- Verification is one batched main-model pass over `[input_token] + drafted_tokens`:
  - fills `input_pos` for `position..position+G`,
  - fills causal mask for `G+1` steps,
  - looks up normal embeddings and Gemma4 per-layer embeddings for all `G+1` tokens,
  - uses the main model's input KV cache and writes the output KV cache for verified/drafted positions.
- Verifier samples `G+1` token IDs from main logits. Accepted tokens are the matching prefix between verifier IDs and drafted IDs. On first mismatch, LiteRT-LM emits the verifier token as a **bonus token**; if all drafts match, it emits verifier ID at index `G` as the bonus token.
- Reported accounting excludes the bonus token: `num_drafted_tokens += G`, `num_verified_tokens += accepted_prefix_len`, and logs success rate on teardown.

Important difference vs the initial go-pherence plan:
- LiteRT-LM's drafter is **not just a standalone tiny autoregressive model**. It consumes the previous token embedding plus a projected activation vector, and the main model needs a verifier path that returns `activations`. This is closer to a hidden-state-conditioned MTP head than a generic auxiliary LM.
- For go-pherence, implement the verifier hidden/activation output first, then wire drafter state. Treat the drafter KV cache question carefully: LiteRT-LM passes base-model KV buffers into the drafter for drafting, and separately uses base-model `verify` to update output KV cache for accepted/drafted candidates.

Performance notes from public HF cards:
- `gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm`: 2.59 GB bundle; text decoder weights 0.79 GB; embeddings 1.12 GB mmap'd. S26 Ultra GPU baseline 51.5 tok/s; speculative decoding task results: 66.5–91.7 tok/s. CPU baseline 40.7 tok/s; speculative task results: 36.3–47.5 tok/s.
- `gemma-4-E4B-it.litertlm`: 3.66 GB bundle; text decoder weights 2.24 GB; embeddings 0.67 GB mmap'd. S26 Ultra GPU baseline 21.9 tok/s; speculative task results: 36.7–49.4 tok/s. CPU baseline 17.0 tok/s; speculative task results: 21.1–29.5 tok/s.
- The HF cards note speculative decoding is task-dependent because drafter agreement varies with prompt/task.

Implementation implications for go-pherence:
1. Add a main-model `Verify(tokens []int)` path that runs a short batched forward, returns logits for each position, updates candidate KV, and exposes final hidden/projected activations.
2. Preserve or compute Gemma4 per-layer embeddings for all verifier tokens; LiteRT-LM explicitly feeds `per_layer_embeddings` to verifier. `Gemma4PerLayerInputs` now provides the single-token primitive used by `Generate` and future verifier code.
3. Model the drafter input as `embedding(prev_token) || activation`, not just token IDs. `PreProjectInto` and `PostProjectInto` implement the projection handoff pieces.
4. Apply acceptance accounting with accepted-prefix length plus bonus token, mirroring LiteRT-LM. `AcceptMTPDraftFromLogits` and `CommitAccepted*KV` are the tested bridge from verifier logits to KV-cache state.
5. Consider a `.litertlm` inspector later: section metadata can reveal whether an artifact includes `tf_lite_mtp_drafter`, but implementing the format is not required for native safetensors MTP.
